# ~~Boring~~ Efficient Meeting Pattern - EMP  *v0.1*


## Why?

The Efficient Meeting Pattern aims to reduce by four times the time spent on "reporting" meetings, which are the "cancer" of our organizations.

## How does it work?

EMP is like an application that offers several levels of features. It can also be compared to a physical or sporting activity where there are different levels based on each person's skill.

## Modules

The principle revolves around a central module that is enriched with satellite modules depending on our level of expectation and maturity.


## How to start?

Efficient Meeting Pattern follows a logic of transformation. It is therefore recommended to gradually start applying the principles and increase the level as the team becomes more engaged.

Below are the details of the 3 EMP levels.


## 3 levels

## The pattern

### Sequence

1. Prepare your meeting
2. Send the invitation including all details following the template
3. Share updates and feedback on the shared document
4. Conduct the meeting

### Meeting agenda & timing
- 5 minutes for Introduction
- 10 minutes for Q&A and potential alerts
- *(Optional)* 30 minutes for collaboration

### Invitation template




#### Meeting title

    [An explicit and attractive title] - Read this before the meeting

It is important to mention that **the invite must be read before** the meeting.

#### Meeting content

You can copy/paste this template and update & remove according to your needs:

---

**Collaboration topic(s):**
   - Topic 1
   - Topic 2 (if required/possible)
   
**Objective:** 
[A clear sentence explaining the objective of the discussion]

**Documents:**
- List all the necessary documents for the meeting (attached to the invite or link included)

**Updates:** 
Please share your updates on this document before the meeting: 
[insert link here]

**Agenda [Example, to be updated]:**
- 5 minutes for Introduction
- 10 minutes for Q&A and potential alerts
- 30 minutes for collaboration

**Methodology:** 
I'm following the [Efficient Meeting Pattern](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) to reduce the time spent in non-productive meetings.
You can find all the details and documentation about [EMP on this page](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/).

[![Level 2](icons/level-perfectionist-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 3](icons/level-nerd-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 1](icons/level-1-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 2](icons/level-2-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 3](icons/level-3-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 

---

In case there is no immediate need to collaborate on a specific topic, you can skip the last 30 minutes of the meeting.


## How to communicate and get adhesion from your team?

Explain the "Why," the starting point, the foundation. The idea is not to add something or propose a "new reorganization." The core of the subject is the meaning of our work and the waste of our resources.

Lead by example. Probably the best way to prove the model's viability.

Communication. Include the image of your badge in your invitations; this should spark curiosity and perhaps even debates.
We have two sets of badges to choose from according to your preferences (copy/paste):

[![Level 1](icons/level-minimalist-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 2](icons/level-perfectionist-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 3](icons/level-nerd-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 1](icons/level-1-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/) 
[![Level 2](icons/level-2-s.png)](https://blamouche.github.io/efficientmeeting/)
